This project is a Java application that functions as a web viewer within a mobile app. It allows users to open a specified website URL directly within the app.

**Features:**

* Opens a provided website URL in a user-friendly web view component.
* May integrate with the native browser (depending on implementation approach).

**Requirements:**

* Java Development Kit (JDK) ([https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/))
* An IDE for Java development (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)
* Android Studio (if targeting Android specifically)

**Additional Notes**

* This is a basic framework. You might need to modify or extend it based on your specific requirements, such as adding functionalities for user input of the URL, handling different screen sizes, or integrating with the native browser.
* Consider using libraries like WebView (Android) or WKWebView (iOS) for more advanced web view functionalities.
* Be mindful of security implications when opening external websites within an app. Make sure the website is trustworthy and implement proper user consent mechanisms if necessary.
